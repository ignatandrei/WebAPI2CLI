# F.A.Q.

## Will my WebAPI work as before?

The software takes care about 

--CLI_ENABLED=1

If you do not have this command, your website runs as before

## I want to run as a CLI and then use the WebAPI as before. Could I do that? 

Yes. Use 

 &lt; myexe &gt;.exe  --CLI_ENABLED=1 --CLI_Commands="your first command,your second command" --CLI_STAY=1
